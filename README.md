# Movie Blog!

### About:

We have all been in quarantine for a long time now and had a lot of time on our hands. If you're anything like us, that means you have watched a lot of movies over the last few months. This application is a place for you to share your thoughts on these movies and read what others thought as well.

### Getting Started:

To begin simply login/sign up for free at the top of the page or search any movie in the top right corner to read others' reviews.

### Built With:

- Axios - promise-based HTTP client

- Dotenv - environment variable loader

- Express.js - Node.js framework
