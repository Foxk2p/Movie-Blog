# Movie Blog!

### About:

The Covid pandemic has placed much of the world in quarantine, which has made it particularly difficult to socialize and share experiences. Like many others in this situation, we initially found ourselves with more time on our hands, and if you're anything like our team, that means you have watched a lot of movies. This application is a place to share thoughts about movies with a passionate online community. It was built to help people connect in our new social terrain through the magic of movies. 

### Getting Started:

To begin, simply login/sign up for free at the top of the page or search any movie in the top right corner to read others' reviews.

### Built With:

- Axios - promise-based HTTP client

- Dotenv - environment variable loader

- Express.js - Node.js framework

- MySQL - SQL Database

- Sequelize - promise-based Node.js ORM
